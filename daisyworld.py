This is an implementation of daisy world: a theoretical 
model of the Gaia hypothesis. This theory was initially developed by 
Lovelock (1983) to demonstrate the plausibility of living things 
interacting with, and regulating, their environment.

#""" 1)  Change the minimum and initial area fractions or each daisy to create three scenarios:
    # A scenario with only white daisies, 2) only black daisies and 3) another where both coexist.
    #What are the ranges of luminosity where daisies can exist for each scenario? Why? 
    
    #Both: Daisies exit fron luminosity 0.62 until 1.45, white daisies from 0.7 until 1.45, black dasies from 0.62 until 1.2
    #only white: Dasies exist from 0.8 until 1.45
    #only black: Dasies exist from 0.62 until 0.99
    # If both kind of dasies exist each kind of dasiy exist within a broader range of luminosity, 
    #because black dasies help white ones to reach their needed tempreture on the planet earlier and white dasies help
    # black ones to cool down the planet through the higher albedo, even within higher luminosity
    
    #2) Increase/decrease the albedos of the daisies, together and separately.
    #How does this affect the survival of the daisies and their ability to moderate the climate?
    
    # add 10% to both albedos: black dasies resist 0.2 luminosity more, white dasies cover more and more surface with higher luminosity
    # climate is similar until 1.4 luminosity and much more balenced after 1.4 aroundd 25 Degrees (old was around 60)
    # substract 10% from both albedos: black dasies only exists until 1.0 luminosity but from 0.62, white ones start existing at 0.62 luminosity already but only until 1.2
    #so all interfaces are moved 0.2 to lower luminosity
    # similar climate in the beginning, but tempreture gets exttremely hot earlier  
    
    #3) Create a parameter for each daisy type that describes the optimum reproduction temperature. 
    #(note: all calculations are done in degrees K). Pass these to the beta function and try creating scenarios 
    #where the daisies have different optimum temperatures. Does having different optimum temperatures improve 
    #survival for the daisies?
    
    #Set derivatives to zero
    
    #4)  Modify the death rate gamma. What does this parameter do and why? 
    
     #when you decrease the death rate dasies will resist higher luminosity
     #when you increase the death rate dasies will resist lower only unnder lower luminosity
     # but startingpoint of covering will remain always the same
     # it's because you have more or lower capasity of dasies, which can lower down the effects of luminosity with their albedo

    #5)  Copy the Daisyworld while loop to create a single simulation with a luminosity of 1, and initial cover fraction 
    #of alphaw=0.2 and alphab=0.5 . Run for as many generations needed until the cover fractions reach equilibrium. 
    #Compare the cover fractions and the planetary temperature. How do the cover fraction change? Why?
    
    # How would you plot the graph with only one stable Luminosity?
